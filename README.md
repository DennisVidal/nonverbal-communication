# Nonverbal-Communication

This application is the result of my bachelor thesis. It utilises a HoloLens to embed a virtual character in the real world. Interaction with this virtual character is possible through a handful of nonverbal means. The two major ones being looking at the character and the distance between the user and the character. All nonverbal interactions trigger a response from the character. Examples of these responses are the looking back at the player, when the character notices the player's gaze, and the adjusting of the characters distance based on the distance to the user and whether the character noticed the player or not. A showcase video can be found [here](https://youtu.be/t2XhstgVzgY "Showcase").
